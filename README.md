## Why are we an awesome team?

We are a multidisciplinary team (honestly, we have never met in person) capable of solving any given task thanks to our different perspectives (well, just perspectives from engineers and economists). Here is a sneak peek form us.
- Victor, Economist and Social Scientist with experience on public policy
- Alejandro Mu√±oz, Engineer in physics and Communicator of science, good at explaining and exploring ideas.  
- Juan Escalona, Mechanical and Electrical engineer with sales experience, customer driven and a Machine Learning enthusiast.
- Salvador Garc√≠a
- Rodrigo Ju√°rez, Business Engineer with a strong analytical and financial education.

All of us are currently pursuing a Master's degree on Data Science at ITAM.  üéì
